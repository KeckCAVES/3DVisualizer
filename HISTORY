3D Visualizer Change History
============================

3D Visualizer 1.0:
- Beginning of history file

3D Visualizer 1.1:
- Redesigned Algorithm API to concentrate information needed to create
  and algorithm object into a new VariableManager class.
- Added preliminary support for multi-data set visualization into new
  VariableManager class.
- Created new Element and Algorithm classes to create isosurfaces of one
  variable that are color-mapped by another variable.
- Added original spherical coordinates as scalar variable fields to many
  modules dealing with spherical coordinates. Together with colored
  seeded isosurfaces, this allows to extract color-mapped radial slices,
  for example.
- Made SeismicTomographyGrid module class more flexible by adding more
  command line options.
- Added version number variable to makefile to simplify moving to a
  simpler installation directory structure in the future.

3D Visualizer 1.2:
- Added ability to load palette files dynamically using Vrui's new file
  selection dialog.
- Lots of cosmetic changes to dialogs.
- Changed order of main menu entries: color submenu is now right after
  algorithm submenu.
- New default appearance of menus inherited from Vrui build 053.
- Fixed makefile to be in line with Visualizer development sources.
- Evaluation dialogs can now measure coordinates in the same system as
  the source data, for example in spherical lat/long/radius coordinates.

3D Visualizer 1.3:
- Bumped required Vrui version to 1.0-056 due to API changes in Vrui.
- Added algorithm to extract global isosurfaces by selecting an isovalue
  with a slider.
- Added ability to save and load extracted visualization elements.
- Added collaboration infrastructure to create spatially distributed
  shared data exploration environments.

3D Visualizer 1.4:
- Added note about not using ~ when setting INSTALLDIR to README and
  makefile.
- Changed make clean to really remove everything.
- Changed visualization element list to use a proper list box.
- Can now delete individual visualization elements.
- Significantly improved locator class for curvilinear grids, improving
  accuracy, reliability, and performance.
- Added safeguard against too small convergence thresholds in locator
  class for curvilinear grids; caused lock-ups on large grids with very
  small grid cells before.
- Adapted 3D Visualizer to Vrui release 1.0-062 and bumped required Vrui
  version to same.
- Fixed a minor memory leak.

3D Visualizer 1.5:
- Adapted 3D Visualizer to Vrui release 1.0-063 and bumped required Vrui
  version to same.

3D Visualizer 1.6:
- Provided new volume rendering implementation using GLSL shaders and
  raycasting for improved visual quality and performance on latest-
  generation graphics cards.
- Created new algorithm to volume-render three independent scalar
  variables simultaneously.
- Created new module for multi-valued image stacks.
- Created new (experimental) module for GoCAD voxet files.

3D Visualizer 1.7:
- Adapted shared visualization protocol to collaboration infrastructure
  version 1.3.

3D Visualizer 1.8:
- Fixed regression bug in volume renderer when using old slice-based
  implementation.
- Adapted 3D Visualizer to Vrui release 2.0-xxx and bumped required Vrui
  version number to same.
- Reimplemented locator algorithms in many grid classes yet again.
- Fixed DICOM image stack module to properly handle more DICOM file
  flavors.
- Added new (experimental) module for multi-valued Cartesian data sets
  read from multiple binary grid files in made-up simple .vol format.
- Forgot updating the HISTORY file, so there are probably a ton more. ;)
- Adapted 3D Visualizer to Vrui release 2.1-xxx and bumped required Vrui
  version number to same.
- Moved template implementation files to .icpp file extension for
  consistency with Vrui library and other packages.

3D Visualizer 1.9:
- Bumped required Vrui version number to 2.2-001.
- Allowed to completely disable data set rendering via the Rendering
  Modes menu.
- Added direct handling of additional scene graphs, with ability to
  toggle visibility of individual scene graphs to Rendering Modes menu.

3D Visualizer 1.10:
- Bumped required Vrui version number to 2.3-001.
- Added custom shader implementation of isosurface illumination model
  for tremendous speed-ups on Nvidia Geforce-level cards.
- Custom shader is incompatible with 3D Visualizer's cutting plane
  algorithm; use Vrui's clipping plane tool (under pointing tools)
  instead.

3D Visualizer 1.11:
- Bumped required Vrui version number to 2.4-001.
- Improved rendering pipeline throughout by minimizing OpenGL context
  state changes.
- Added shader-based renderer for color-mapped isosurfaces for moderate
  speed-ups on Nvidia Geforce-level cards.
- Added comment skipping (# marks comment up to end of line) to input
  metafile (.in) parser.
- Added comment-skipping (# marks comment up to end of line) to
  ImageStack's stack descriptor parser.
- Made ImageStack class cluster-aware to reduce data set load times in
  cluster environments.
- Added module class SCTFile for Cartesian single-channel volumetric
  data sets created by LLNL-developed reprojection code.

3D Visualizer 1.12:
- Bumped required Vrui version number to 2.5-001.
- Fixed line parser error in StructuredHexahedralTecplotASCIIFile.
- Small changes to build system in line with Vrui.
- Fixed build error; forgot an object file. Pointed out by Rob Porritt.

3D Visualizer 1.13:
- Fixed matrix stack handling error in Visualizer::display that affected
  rendering of embedded scene graphs.
- Bumped required Vrui version number to 2.7-001.
- Improved variable manager to properly handle "empty" scalar value
  ranges.

3D Visualizer 1.14:
- Improved background frame buffer management in Raycaster.
- Bumped required Vrui version number to 3.0-002.

3D Visualizer 1.15:
- Adapted 3D Visualizer to recent changes in Vrui API.
- Bumped required Vrui version number to 4.2-006.
- Removed several potential race conditions in GL state management that
  could have caused spurious crashes.
