3D Visualizer Change History
============================

3D Visualizer 1.0:
- Beginning of history file

3D Visualizer 1.1:
- Redesigned Algorithm API to concentrate information needed to create
  and algorithm object into a new VariableManager class.
- Added preliminary support for multi-data set visualization into new
  VariableManager class.
- Created new Element and Algorithm classes to create isosurfaces of one
  variable that are color-mapped by another variable.
- Added original spherical coordinates as scalar variable fields to many
  modules dealing with spherical coordinates. Together with colored
  seeded isosurfaces, this allows to extract color-mapped radial slices,
  for example.
- Made SeismicTomographyGrid module class more flexible by adding more
  command line options.
- Added version number variable to makefile to simplify moving to a
  simpler installation directory structure in the future.

3D Visualizer 1.2:
- Added ability to load palette files dynamically using Vrui's new file
  selection dialog.
- Lots of cosmetic changes to dialogs.
- Changed order of main menu entries: color submenu is now right after
  algorithm submenu.
- New default appearance of menus inherited from Vrui build 053.
- Fixed makefile to be in line with Visualizer development sources.
- Evaluation dialogs can now measure coordinates in the same system as
  the source data, for example in spherical lat/long/radius coordinates.

3D Visualizer 1.3:
- Bumped required Vrui version to 1.0-056 due to API changes in Vrui.
- Added algorithm to extract global isosurfaces by selecting an isovalue
  with a slider.
- Added ability to save and load extracted visualization elements.
- Added collaboration infrastructure to create spatially distributed
  shared data exploration environments.

3D Visualizer 1.4:
- Added note about not using ~ when setting INSTALLDIR to README and
  makefile.
- Changed make clean to really remove everything.
- Changed visualization element list to use a proper list box.
- Can now delete individual visualization elements.
- Significantly improved locator class for curvilinear grids, improving
  accuracy, reliability, and performance.
- Added safeguard against too small convergence thresholds in locator
  class for curvilinear grids; caused lock-ups on large grids with very
  small grid cells before.
- Adapted 3D Visualizer to Vrui release 1.0-062 and bumped required Vrui
  version to same.
- Fixed a minor memory leak.

3D Visualizer 1.5:
- Adapted 3D Visualizer to Vrui release 1.0-063 and bumped required Vrui
  version to same.
