3D Visualizer Change History
============================

3D Visualizer 1.0:
- Beginning of history file

3D Visualizer 1.1:
- Redesigned Algorithm API to concentrate information needed to create
  and algorithm object into a new VariableManager class.
- Added preliminary support for multi-data set visualization into new
  VariableManager class.
- Created new Element and Algorithm classes to create isosurfaces of one
  variable that are color-mapped by another variable.
- Added original spherical coordinates as scalar variable fields to many
  modules dealing with spherical coordinates. Together with colored
  seeded isosurfaces, this allows to extract color-mapped radial slices,
  for example.
- Made SeismicTomographyGrid module class more flexible by adding more
  command line options.
- Added version number variable to makefile to simplify moving to a
  simpler installation directory structure in the future.

3D Visualizer 1.2:
- Added ability to load palette files dynamically using Vrui's new file
  selection dialog.
- Lots of cosmetic changes to dialogs.
- Changed order of main menu entries: color submenu is now right after
  algorithm submenu.
- New default appearance of menus inherited from Vrui build 053.
- Fixed makefile to be in line with Visualizer development sources.
- Evaluation dialogs can now measure coordinates in the same system as
  the source data, for example in spherical lat/long/radius coordinates.
